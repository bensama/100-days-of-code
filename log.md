# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created my first CLi

**Thoughts:** Really interested in how a CLI works. I was following a tutorial by Traversy Media. The tutorial was a little outdated and the mongoDb functions he was using were depreciated so I had some debugging to do.
